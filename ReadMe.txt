IDK what you put in these...

build requirements i guess:
 - you need SFML 2.5 or later
 - probably some other stuff
 - build with: "./build.sh"

how to run:
 - for the server, run: "./Server"
 - for the client, run: "./Client", and input the server ip address

controls:
 - WASD to move
 - x button to close
